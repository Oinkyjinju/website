          This three had the most similar concept and ideas for target audience. <br> HoneyCo is the only company focusing on a specific target audience. Such as aging aduts and family for care giving needs.
        Whereas, Smarthome and Best Buy focus on a middle-class family who wants to improve their house quality through both VI smart product and non-VI interfaced smart home devices. <br><br>
            Smarthome and Best Buy is a franchised retail store with assorted smart devices for a quick and simple search. Brand are limited and not all the employees are informed about the products they are selling.
            These two companies provide a product under particular categories (i.e., Lightning, thermostats, security, door lock, more home control) Where the product is specifically offer to improve the house quality.<br><br>
            Meanwhile, HoneyCo puts a value in the needs of helping the uses' care giving routines and easy communications through VI based smart products.</h6></div></div>

<div class="title-box2"><h1>Product Decision</h1></div>
    <h4>This project was done before COVID 19</h4>
    
    <h5>Purpose of Offline Store</h5>
      <div class="text-box"><h6>From the survey, one of the results showed that the system needs to be improved in recognition and context to understand what types of benefits a user can experienceby using a smart product.
        Increasing the recognition and understanding of benefits in using  smart product is truly hrd to manifest as a short-term goal.<br><br>
        Therefore, the soution of the Connect project focuses on developing an environment that can build the prime context in benefits of smart products to baby boomers.
        As a result, the solution is to develp an indpendent section in a franchised retail environment Connect can increase the recognition of smart product from the baby boomer based on their purchase behavior.<br><br>
        Baby boomer invets more attention towards the information of the product than the inventory, which leads them to be in a phsycial store environment to experience and learn the product.
        In additional resutlt, the commonly known franchise retail store builds trust, existing communication, and easy access to information. The "Tryout Room" can build a home environment to provide a comfortable experience while user is experiencing the product. 
        Which may deliver positive outcome in product experience.
